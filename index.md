# Nathan Beerbower's First CS19300 Homework

I'm thrilled to be taking this class as part of the beginnning of my Purdue CS journey! Here are a few things I've loved about the class thus far:

### What makes CS19300 so fantastic
- Amazing teachers
- Relevant skills (GitHub and Terminal commands)
- Connection with other first-year CS, DS, and AI students
- Amazing memes
- An all-around awesome experience to begin my first year at Purdue!

I appreciate all the time and efforts my teachers are putting in to make this course as phenomenal as it is. I am thankful for this opportunity and look forward to growing my knowledge as the year progresses!
